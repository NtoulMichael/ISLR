```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## To start with,
We  are going scale our data set properly and try to compute the constant K


$$euclidean\approx K * correlation$$

```{r}
USA.scale <- scale(USArrests)

correlation <- as.dist(1-cor(t(USA.scale)))
euclidean <- dist(USA.scale)^2

summary(correlation/euclidean)
```
Lets say K = Median = 0.133943 
```{r}
summary(correlation - 0.133943*euclidean )
```
If K=0.1339 then they are approximately equal, different only 0.000004 on average.
